As the amount of textual data grows exponentially in the last decades, effective information retrieval becomes central in high-level decision making. In this work, we provide an abstractive text summarization model under the attentional encoder-decoder framework using the ELMo embedding and the adaptive softmax. We evaluated our model's performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on the Annotated English Gigaword corpus. The qualitative results demonstrate our model's adequacy in headline generation tasks. A quantitative comparison of using different word embeddings under this framework is also provided.
