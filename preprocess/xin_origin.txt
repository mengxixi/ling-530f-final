the guarantee and supervision as the key, and the soil that breeds corruption
should be continuously removed through deepening reform. A number of laws and
regulations on combating corruption and building a clean government were
enacted, thus further improving the anti-corruption system. Anti- corruption and

Promoting the reform of the financial system. China separates the business
operations of the Central Bank from those of commercial banks, as well as of
banks from those of securities firms and insurance companies, and detaches
policy-based finance from commercial finance. Efforts have been made to
constantly strengthen and improve macro financial control, establish and improve
the separated financial regulatory systems for banking, securities and insurance
industries, tighten financial oversight to gradually regulate the order of
financial markets. The systems of information disclosure and credit rating have
been established and improved to promote the rapid, healthy development of the
financial markets in the country. Efforts have been made to press ahead with a
series of major financial reforms towards introducing the shareholding system in
state-owned commercial banks, restructuring of securities firms, and equity
reorganization of joint venture insurance companies by injecting more funds from
Chinese enterprises to gain control, to further improve the corporate governance
structure, fully sort out and manage historically accumulated financial risks,
and initially establish a system to protect investors. Positive efforts are
being made to promote the establishment of a payment system, extend the use of
non-cash payment tools, improve the system of real-name financial accounts, and
effectively prevent and severely crack down on corruption activities by means of
bank accounts, securities markets and capital operations. A basic database of
the credit of enterprises and individuals across the country has been
established, and work has been done to speed up the construction of a unified
credit information platform of the financial sector. Work has been done to
establish a series of systems, such as system of customer identification, system
of report and record of large-sum and suspicious transactions so as to
strengthen regulation over anti-money laundering. These reform measures have not
only promoted the standardized, healthy development of the financial sector, but
also helped ward off financial risks and corruption.

The people's procuratorates can, in accordance with the law, directly file cases
of job-related crimes committed by state functionaries for investigation, such
as embezzlement, bribery, dereliction of duty and infringement on citizens'
rights, and initiate public prosecution to the people's courts on behalf of the
state. Accepting reports on such crimes and cases transferred from relevant
departments, the procuratorial organs launch timely examinations and initial
investigations of the clues of the reported crimes and materials regarding the
cases. For those cases in which criminal facts are evident and criminal
liability needs to be prosecuted, the procuratorial organs file them for
investigation in accordance with legal procedures, and ascertain the criminal
facts of the suspects in accordance with the law. Following the conclusion of
investigation, the procuratorial organs shall deal with them in accordance with
the law on the basis of ascertained facts and evidence. For those cases of which
there are verified facts and ample evidence and for which criminal liability
needs to be prosecuted in accordance with the law, the departments of the
people's procuratorates dealing with embezzlement, bribery, dereliction of duty
and infringements on rights shall transfer them to the departments in charge of
public prosecution for examination before the latter initiate legal proceedings
in the people's courts. From 2003 to 2009, the people's procuratorates at all
levels filed for investigation more than 240,000 cases of embezzlement, bribery,
dereliction of duty and infringements on rights. Battling the crime of taking
bribes, China has improved a database on criminal records of bribery, and
intensified efforts in punishing and preventing crime of bribery. In 2009, some
3,194 people were punished for their criminal liability in offering bribes.
